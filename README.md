# thinkfan
Tired of the hum? I hear you. Thinkfan lets you silence a ThinkPad laptop in Plan 9. It is inspired by [the identically named Linux program](http://thinkfan.sourceforge.net).  

The program is dead simple. Run `thinkfan` without arguments and it tells you the current fan speed. Give it a number in the 0 to 7 range, and it sets the fan speed accordingly. Zero means off, 7 indicates the maximum speed. That's all. I am relying on Intel to throttle the processor before it overheats. So far I haven't fried any chips. Your mileage may differ. I do run `stats -z` on my desktop and keep an eye on the temperature. When it approaches 100Â°C and the laptop slows down I increase the fan speed. 

I have successfully tested this program on Lenovo ThinkPad models X220 and X230.

## Installation
`cp thinkfan /rc/bin/`

`echo thinkfan 1 >>/cfg/$sysname/termrc`
